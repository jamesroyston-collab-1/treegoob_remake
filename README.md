# treegoob_remake

## Welcome to the remake for https://www.marktreegoob.com/.

This project was created to solidify the HTML and CSS fundamentals. We will be using Github to learn about the basic usage of git and gh-pages as well.

The git commands we aim to learn with this project are:
Main:
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m 'your message here'`
- `git push` / `git push -u origin master`

Other:
- `git checkout "branch name"`
- `git -b ~branch name~`
