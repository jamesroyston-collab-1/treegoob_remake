# treegoob_remake

## Welcome to the remake for this site ("add site link here").

This project was created to solidify the HTML and CSS fundamentals. We will be using Github to learn about the basic usage of git and gh-pages as well.
The git commands we aim to learn with this project are:
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m 'your message here'`
- `git push` / `git push -u origin master`
- `git remote add origin "SSH URL"` (this step was taken care of by James already. John, we will cover this later. 
- `git checkout "branch name"`
- `git -b ~branch name~`
